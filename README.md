Tube emulator developed using [iPlug2](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2) currently in Alpha stage. I'm a newby at DSP, this project is meant just for learning.  
Based on iPlug2's IPlugEffect example.  
Only tested as VST3 within Reaper on Windows, I have no money for a Mac neither money for an Apple developer license.  
To build this project follow the setup instructions for iPlug2, then download this code and use it under iPlug2/Examples or any other folder at the same level.
I use a folder iPlug2/Projects.
