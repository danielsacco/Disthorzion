# Disthorzion

![Tubby](gui-design/Tubby.png)

Basic Tube distortion simulator developed using [iPlug2](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2) currently in Alpha stage.
Based on DAFX Second Edition Udo ZÃ¶lzer section 4.3.1.  
I'm a newby at DSP, this project is meant just for learning.  
Based on iPlug2's IPlugEffect example.  
Only tested as VST3 within Reaper on Windows, I have no money for a Mac neither money for an Apple developer license.  

# Try it !

To build this project follow the setup instructions for iPlug2, then download this code and use it under iPlug2/Examples or any other folder at the same level.
I use a folder iPlug2/Projects.

Open `Disthorzion.sln`, this will open the project in Visual Studio (tested on Version 17.5.3)

To use it as an standalone app set Disthorzion-app as Startup project in Solution Explorer then run it.  
To try it as a VST3 plugin you can build Disthorzion-vst3 then use the plugin in your favourite DAW, or if you have [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/index.php) installed, then set Disthorzion-vst3 as Startup project in Solution Explorer then run it directrly from Visual Studio.
